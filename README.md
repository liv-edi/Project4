## Project 4

In this project we cerated a REST API that works with a data source of questions and answers. We created the code to work with the data source using a code module, and tested the code module using text code that was provided. We also created a Node.js Rest API to handle the GET verb.

Technologies used for this project:
- VSCode
- Node.js

The purpose of this project was to gain experience interpreting writing.executing server side Node.js code using VSCode, writing/executing Node.js REST API server using VSCode, using Fastify with GET verb, routes, and route parameters, working with data, testing code modules, using Postman to test web server outes, and working with JSON. We also were able to practice creating/ using code modules and using modern JS syntax.

I did not do this project.
